        <p class="text-primary">How are course details made available to SEAT?</p>
        SEAT gets course details from workflow. Departments send these details (course capacities,
    ranking criteria, etc) to workflow through the slotbook every semester.<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">What course details are relevant to SEAT?</p>
    For the purposes of SEAT, a course has two types of information:
		<ol>
		<li><u>Permanent Information:</u> This includes the course description, references,
prerequisites etc. All this information is present in the Course Master. Modifying this
information is done via approval through BAC and Senate.</li>
<li><u>Information pertaining to the particular offering of the course:</u> This includes the
following : is this course available for SEAT, course capacity for SEAT, Outside
Capacity for SEAT, ranking criteria. These parameters are specific to the offering of
the course and can change across offerings. All this information is uploaded to
slotbook during slot-wise listing.</li>
		</ol> Both the pieces of information are crucial for SEAT. It is possible that for some courses the
Permanent Information is not up to date. We encourage departments to get this information
in place for the benefit of the students. However since changing Permanent information
requires approvals, workflow has enabled a short-cut to updating course description and
prerequisites for the current offering of the course. It should be noted that prerequisites
entered using this shortcut will not be enforced, and are only for the students’ information.<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">What are the course details that need to be provided for SEAT for each offering?</p>
		During slotbook update, departments provide the following details for each course.
    <ol>
      <li> Is this course available for 2015 batch and later students as an elective course? (In
case you choose to tick this, then please ensure that the prerequisites for the course
are correctly entered in course master.)</li>
  <li> Total Capacity (how many students should SEAT allot to the course?)</li>
    <li> Outside Capacity (how many students from outside parent dept. should SEAT allot to
the course?)</li>
    <li> Ranking Criteria (what ranking criteria should be used if there are more students
interested that the available capacity?</li>
    </ol><br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">
      What is the difference between Total Capacity (TOT CAP) and Outside Capacity (OUT
  CAP)?</p>
  The Total Capacity denotes the maximum number of students that SEAT will allot to the
course. Note that only 2015 batch and later BTech / DD students fall under the purview of
SEAT -- we call such students as under the purview of SEAT students. A course may also
be credited by BTech/ DD students from 2014 and earlier batches and postgraduate
students (MTech, MS, PhD). We call such students as outside the purview of SEAT
students. Note that outside the purview of SEAT students are not accounted for in Total
Capacity. Therefore, the Total Capacity should NOT be confused with Class Size (which is
used for room allocation etc).<br/>
The Outside Capacity denotes the number of external (outside department) students that
SEAT can allocate to a course. For example, suppose a course CS2800 from the CSE
department is available for outside department students and can accommodate 10 students
from outside CSE. In this case the Outside Capacity for CS2800 is 10. Again, these 10
students are only from 2015 and later batches.<br/>
Note that the Total Capacity includes Outside Capacity and Within Department Capacity, but
does not include students who fall outside SEAT purview (BTech/ DD 2014 and earlier and
All MTech, MS, and PhD).<br/><br/>

<p class="text-primary">
  How do I split my Class Size between students under purview of SEAT and outside purview
of SEAT?</p>For this, we do not have a clear answer. We request departments to take a call based on
historical data. Going forward, as a larger set of students fall under the purview of SEAT, we
expect that the estimation will become easier.<br/><br/>
<p class="text-primary">
  How do faculty members communicate extra details for this offering of the course?</p>Once the slotbook is approved by the TTC Chair, individual faculty members can provide
data pertaining to courses that they will be offering in the upcoming semester. They can fill
these details by logging into workflow and navigating to Academics → Course Details; a
sample screenshot is provided below. In this screen, individual course instructors can
provide the following inputs.
<img src="images/courseDet.png" width="700px" height="300px"/>
The instructor can provide a brief description of the course (Proposed content) and the
background knowledge expected (Prerequisite). Note that this information on background
knowledge is only for students to read manually. <em>At this stage SEAT cannot use this
information to validate whether students have the necessary prerequisites.</em>
<br/><br/>
<p class="text-primary">
  What about COT for courses?</p>With this new system in place, COT will change its form -- instead of students going around
with paper forms, the COT is specified by the teacher indirectly. At the time of filling the
slot-book, course instructors will provide course capacity and ranking criteria. Thus,
instructors can control the number of students allocated to the course as well as the ranking
criteria. Departments are requested to update the course master with appropriate
prerequisites and course equivalences for all their courses through appropriate channels (via
BAC, Senate etc). SEAT has essentially automated the manual task of instructors inspecting
the student’s eligibility for the course and the task of selecting students from the pool of
interested students.<br/><br/>
<p class="text-primary">
  What are different ranking criteria?</p>Please see Question in Student FAQ (Reference to Page-5) for a detailed description of
various ranking criteria. We expect the departments to provide us with ranking criteria for
courses offered in each semester. The default is set to Stratified Random.<br/><br/>

		<p class="text-primary">What are inputs to SEAT?</p>
		SEAT uses workflow to get its input from students. Every student who wishes to credit
		electives in a particular semester, should submit the following:
		<ol>
		<li>The maximum number of credits (including both elective and core credits, default is
		60) he/she wants to register for in the particular semester, and </li>
		<li> An exhaustive list of courses in an order of preference.</li>
		<li> A colour for each course</li>
		</ol> <br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">How do I know what courses I am eligible to take?</p>
		Workflow shows you all the courses that are being offered across different departments that
		are available as electives. It is highly recommended that you ensure that you have the
		background knowledge (prerequisites) to credit the course. You can do this by checking the
		course details on the academic website, visiting the course home page and/or talking to the
		faculty offering the course.<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">
		How do I form my preference list when I have several types of electives to credits like
		Humanities, Mathematics and others?</p>
		Once you have ensured that you meet the prerequisites for a set of courses, create a single
		list containing all the courses that you wish to give a preference for. Your preference list can
		contain multiple courses in the same slot. The SEAT software will ensure that you do not
		have any slot conflicts. Next, you have to colour code the courses in your preference list.<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">What is a colour for a course in the student’s preference list?</p>
    Students may have a subset of courses in their preference list from which they wish to pick
only one. In that case, the student should give all the courses in this subset a single colour.
There is no restriction on the number of courses that can be grouped under one colour, but it
should be noted that every course can get at most 1 colour.<br/>
For example, a student may have several courses from the Maths department in his
preference list, but wants to be allotted at most one of them. He should colour all those
courses in the same colour.<br/>
If you do not wish to give a course any colour, choose the “no colour” option . Among the
courses that are with the “no colour option”, a student can get allotted multiple courses,
subject to their credit limit.<br/>
It should be noted that there is no need to colour courses in the same slot with a single
colour. The SEAT software takes care of slot conflicts.<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">What about COT (Consent of Teacher) for courses?</p>
    There is no more paper COT for students starting from 2015-16 batch. COT has been
replaced with course prerequisites and course capacities declared for SEAT.<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">What are the different ranking criteria for courses to rank students?</p>
    Every course has a ranking criteria associated with it. Types of ranking criteria currently
available in SEAT are:
<ol>
  <li><b>Stratified Random:</b> The course with stratified random as their ranking criteria will
prioritize all students who gave this course as a top-choice over any student who
gave it as a second choice, and so on. Amongst all students who gave the course as
a top choice, a random order of ranking is used.</li>
  <li><b>Random:</b> The course with random as the ranking criteria will order all students
interested in the course in a random order.</li>
  <li><b>CGPA:</b> The course with CGPA as their ranking criteria will compare students based
on their CGPA till last semester. Students with higher CGPA will be given more
preference over students with lower CGPA.</li>
</ol>Consider the following example: say there are 5 students S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 who have listed
course C in their preference list according to the table below:
<table class="blueTable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>S1</th>
<th>S2</th>
<th>S3</th>
<th>S4</th>
<th>S5</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Position of C
in
student
preference
order</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CGPA of
student</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>9.2</td>
<td>8.5</td>
<td>8.5</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Under <b>stratified random​</b> criterion, the first three students S1, S2, and S3 will be randomly
permuted amongst themselves followed by a random permutation of the last two (i.e., S4
and S5). For example, S2, S1, S3, S5, S4 is a possible stratified random ordering, but S2,
S3, S4, S1, S5 is not.<br/>
Under <b>random</b> ​criterion, one of the 5! permutations of the five students will be chosen
uniformly at random.<br/>
Under <b>CGPA</b>​ criterion, one of (S2, S3, S4, S1, S5) and (S2, S4, S3, S1, S5) will be chosen
uniformly at random. (In other words, ties are broken randomly.)
It should be noted that the ranking order is an expression of instructors preference over
students interested in the course. Since student preferences are also taken into consideration by SEAT, the top k students ranked by the course (where k is the capacity of
the course) may not be allocated to the course.
<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">How is ranking criteria different from pre-requisites?</p>
    Pre-requisites are used to decide if a student is eligible for a given course. Ranking criteria
on the other hand, like ‘CGPA’ or ‘Random’ as discussed above, are used to rank the eligible
students for allotment in the presence of limitations such as course capacities.<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">What are some of the things students should keep in mind when filling preferences?</p>
    A student will provide his maximum credit limit (including core course credits). This
maximum credit limit cannot exceed 60. The student will not be allotted more credits than the
maximum credit limit, but it is possible that his credit limit will not be met if the student does
not provide a long enough preference list or makes a mistake (like colouring all his courses
with the same colour). In this case, the student is advised to apply for courses in the 2nd
round. Hence a student should make his preference list sufficiently long.<br/>
A student must responsibly choose the colours for courses in their preference list. If he or
she makes a mistake like putting all courses in a single colour, or putting all HS courses in
different colours, it will not be considered as an error, since it is a valid input.<br/>
“No colour” option indicates that courses under that group are uncoloured, ie, any number of
courses can be allotted from the set of courses with “no colour”.<br/><br/>
		<p class="text-primary">What happens to students who do not get allocated enough electives or are dissatisfied with
some of their allotted courses?</p>
The best way to avoid dissatisfaction is to do a thorough homework of the available courses
and provide a well thought out and sufficiently long ordering of courses.<br/>
If the student is not satisfied with the electives allocated to him/her, one can opt for
dropping/replacing the course(s). The drop option is similar to the traditional drop, the
student simply deregisters for the allocated elective and accepts that he/she does not want
any other elective. The replace option is a 2-step process -- the first step is to drop the
course. In the next step, the student can provide a fresh list of preferences, however only on
the courses which have vacancies after the first allotment. Note that student is not
guaranteed to get allotted to a course in the replace and might remain unallotted.<br/><br/>
