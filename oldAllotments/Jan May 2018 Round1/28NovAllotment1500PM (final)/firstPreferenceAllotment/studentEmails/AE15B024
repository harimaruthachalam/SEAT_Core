Dear Student,
From the data obtained from workflow we see that you have not registered for courses during the registration week. Owing to this, no courses have been allotted to you via SEAT.

Please write to seat@wmail.iitm.ac.in if you have any issues with the allotment. No paper requests will be entertained.

Best Regards,
SEAT Team
