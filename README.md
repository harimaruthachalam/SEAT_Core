# seatv0.2
##Building the Project

Just run ‘make’ from the folder containing the ‘Makefile’ file. It will handle the building of the project and output a SEAT.jar file. The software can then be run by issuing the command ‘java -jar SEAT.jar’.

The Manifest.mf file is needed by the Makefile to know which the main function of the application is. It should either be set to MainWithGUI or MainWithoutGUI.

Alternatively, you can import the project into an IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans or IntelliJ and it will manage the building of the project for you.
